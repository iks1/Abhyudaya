# Understanding the problem


Quoting the words of Koraput District DM as spoken to TheHindu on 2016 "_Students earn their degrees but are not able to get jobs because they do not know about competitive examinations. They remain confused and spoil their career for failing to choose the right vocation_‚Äù . The problem being simple "_Lack of awareness_" ,this surely dials down the burning temperament of aspirants . 


With increasing number of students , hear-say of random rumors, people have opened websites selling so-called career guidance courses , asking personal information in return of negligible help but this further escalates to compromising privacy;unwarranted promotional mails and calls from private institutions.

And here we are filling that gap , by building an autonomous digital interface which can act as bridge between aspirations and awareness we provide them a kickstart to their success story . Unlike above we'll make sure every student of odisha takes benefit of it .  



# Our Solution


We aim to promote Student empowerment through spreading awareness regarding different exams. 
* This portal cuts down the time killing and prevents from building up on their doubts. 
* Students no more have to depend upon ‚Äúdidi-bhaiya‚Äù Source, or take decisions just cause parents said so .
* Students get an ease of access to understand different types of exams and many confusing doubts.

Apart from helping students with career guidance we can use our portal to get search statistics ( as in which age group seeks which sort of exams , hence govt officials can easily put their focus on that and take actions to promote it further).

_We don't say our website guarantees the Success , but it definitely increases the odds of getting it._
